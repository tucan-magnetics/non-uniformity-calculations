# Non-Uniformity Calculations

This is a repository for the calculations done to characterize the spherical harmonic decomposition coefficients for a magnetic field in terms of the magnetic field itself. All code used can be found in ``UCN-Glm.wls``, while a report on the method and findings can be found in the ``report`` folder.
