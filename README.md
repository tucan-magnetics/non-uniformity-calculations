# Magnetic field parametrization

This is a repository for the calculations done to characterize the spherical harmonic decomposition coefficients for a magnetic field in terms of the magnetic field itself. All code used can be found in ``UCN-Glm.wls``, while a report on the method and findings can be found in the following Overleaf project: https://www.overleaf.com/read/tdstsyfbbtgp. Note that this only gives read access as this is a public repo.
